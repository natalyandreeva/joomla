COM_CSVI_WIZARD_STEP_EXPLANATION="Explanation"
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_IMPORT_STEP1="CSVI uses templates where you can set your preferences for an import or export you want to do. The very first step is to give the template a name and specify which operation you want to perform."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_IMPORT_STEP2="CSVI can retrieve your import file from various locations, here we tell CSVI where to find the file you want to import."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_IMPORT_STEP3="Here we give CSVI some more information about the file you are going to import. Most important is the option if CSVI should use your file to configure the import. If your file has field names that are known to CSVI, this can be left unchanged. If your file has field names that are <strong>not</strong> known to CSVI, this must be set to No. In the next step you can then add the mapping between your fields and the CSVI fields. You can find a list of supported field names in the <a href=""index.php?option=com_csvi&view=availablefields"" target=""_new"">Available Fields</a> list."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_IMPORT_STEP4="CSVI works based on field names. The field names can either be set in your import file or in the template."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_IMPORT_STEP5="All set and done. Your template is now ready for import."
COM_CSVI_WIZARD_IMPORT_FIELDS_NEEDED="Your file does not have the fields known to CSVI, in this case you need to tell CSVI which fields. For each field in your file, you must add a field to this template. You can read up on adding template fields in the <a href=""https://csvimproved.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1084:adding-tempate-fields&catid=22:questions-and-answers&Itemid=252"">Adding template fields</a> page. Clicking the <strong>Edit template fields</strong> button will open a new window where you can add fields to this template."
COM_CSVI_WIZARD_IMPORT_FIELDS_NOT_NEEDED="You do not need to add any fields to the template because you have selected the option Use file for configuration in step 2. This option will read the first line from your import file and use these fields for the import."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_EXPORT_STEP1="CSVI uses templates where you can set your preferences for an import or export you want to do. The very first step is to give the template a name and specify which operation you want to perform."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_EXPORT_STEP2="CSVI can export your file to various destinations, here we tell CSVI where to export the file to. Multiple destinations can be selected."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_EXPORT_STEP3="Here we give CSVI some more information about the file and the data you are going to export."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_EXPORT_STEP4="CSVI works based on field names. To know which fields to export, you must add the fields to your template. You can read up on adding template fields in the <a href=""https://csvimproved.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1084:adding-tempate-fields&catid=22:questions-and-answers&Itemid=252"">Adding template fields</a> page. Clicking the <strong>Edit template fields</strong> button will open a new window where you can add fields to this template."
COM_CSVI_TEMPLATE_EXPLAIN_EXPORT_STEP5="All set and done. Your template is now ready for export."

COM_CSVI_WIZARD_IMPORT_FINALIZE="There are a lot more settings that can be set, these will be available when you edit the template. A word of advice, take things step by step and make sure you understand what is happening. If there is any doubt, you can always ask on <a href=""https://csvimproved.com/forum"" target=""_new"">the forum</a> for more information."
COM_CSVI_WIZARD_EXPORT_FINALIZE_NO_FIELDS="Your template is not ready yet, you have not added any fields, make sure you do that before you use the template otherwise the export will not run."
COM_CSVI_WIZARD_EXPORT_FINALIZE="There are a lot more settings that can be set, these will be available when you edit the template. A word of advice, take things step by step and make sure you understand what is happening. There is no need to export all fields that are in the available fields list.
